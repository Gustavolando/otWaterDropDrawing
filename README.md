## CSS Water Drop Drawing

This is one of the most outstanding visual effect I have ever made in CSS.  I have seen many CSS draws with very artistic and sophisticated outcomes, but many of them useless, but this one is simple, neat and easy to use to literally "refresh" a web site or app. 

I practiced here Shadows, insets, and border-radios manipulation.

Simple and neat HTML and CSS code.
